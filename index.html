          The Secret to Mountains of “#1 Fans”
        </h1>

        <p class="fs-lg-20 fs-16 font-normal text-center">
          Ever since I was in junior high, I’ve had girls around me who are “fans.”<br><br>
          #1 fans… girls who crush-stalk me for months or even YEARS…<br><br>
          Girls who give me subtle and not-so-subtle hints they want me to be their boyfriend…<br><br>
          Even girls who cornered me to ask me out on dates THEMSELVES.<br><br>
          And we aren’t talking nerd girls and weirdos!<br><br>
          When I was in junior high AND high school, every single one of the cheerleading captains and co-captains asked
          me out on dates.

        <p class="text-center fs-16 pt-10 px-8">
          These were the hottest, most popular girls in school, girls OTHER guys were chasing after constantly, and
          these girls asked out ME.<br><br>
          I was just that good…<br><br>
          And this has continued over the decades since.<br><br>
          It’s not because I’m super good-looking (I’m not). It’s not because I’m an athlete… in fact I used to read
          books in school while the other boys played football.<br><br>
          Yet even back then, and ever since then, any social situation I find myself in, any group of people, in very
          short order I take it over and turn the girls in it into my adoring FANS.<br><br>
          You’ve seen those guys girls gather around… the ones where the guy says something funny and the girls just
          laugh that full, throaty laugh… one that lets you KNOW that guy can have any one of those girls he wants,
          right?
        </p>

        <p class="text-center fs-16  pt-10">
          Or just imagine the last time you felt JEALOUS of a guy… it’s a good bet he was like that.
          <br><br>
          That’s what I’ve had going on since I got really into teasing as a teenager.

        <div class="flex-grow-1 fs-20 me-lg-28">
          For decades, attraction scientists have posited that women have TWO
          (2) distinct mating strategies. <br /><br />
          These two strategies are aptly named <br /><br />
          <ol class="fw-bold mb-0 ps-20">
            <li class="mb-lg-25">
              Short-term mating (i.e., hookups, one-night stands, and flings),
              and
            </li>
            <li>
              Long-term mating (i.e., boyfriends, fiancés, and marriage)
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          Women after short-term mates look for VERY different qualities than
          those who’re after long-term. <br /><br />
          And here’s the thing: girls don’t CHASE those long-term guys.
          <br /><br />
          It doesn’t look very becoming for his future wife to do the chasing,
          after all.<br />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-20 mb-0">
        They only chase sexy short-term guys.
        <br /><br />
        If you want to get girls chasing you, you must flip her into
        “short-term mating” mode!
        <br /><br />
        However, there’s a catch…
        <br /><br />
        The qualities that make men compelling long-term mates aren’t sexy AT
        ALL for short-term flings!
        <br /><br />
        If you’ve ever watched a friend, or a brother, or a cousin who always
        had girls chasing after him, you’ve seen it in action:
        <br /><br />
        He walks up to girls, talks to them in this sort of way you NEVER
        would if you were trying to get a long-term girlfriend… later on, you
        notice girls SEEK him OUT, or even start COMPETING for him amongst
        themselves… later still, he’s ‘picked a winner’, who ends up at his
        place with her panties on the floor while he rails her brains out.
        <br /><br />
        Then, if he really likes her, he switches his strategy a SECOND time
        and six months later they’re still together, her now a loyal, devoted
        girlfriend.
        <br /><br />
        They might even end up MARRIED with kids… with her STILL chasing him
        inside the marriage (so their relationship never gets stale the way
        your other friends’ marriages do)… and you’re still scratching your
        head, wondering how he even got that “out of his league” girlfriend in
        the first place, not to mention how he got her to CHASE him and KEEP
        chasing him.
        <br /><br />
        All he can tell you with a shrug though is,
        <span class="color-orange">
          “I don’t know, man. Just don’t be too pushy with girls! Let THEM do
          the chasing!”
        </span>
        <br /><br />
        Like THAT helps!
        <br /><br />
        So how’d he do it?
        <br /><br />
        What’s this SECRET some men know to get girls chasing them that so
        many others don’t?
        <br /><br />
        It’s a secret that allows a guy to make girls
        <span class="color-orange">‘starstruck’</span> in his presence… to get
        girls following around after him… to get them CHASING him… and to have
        them so firmly flipped out of ‘long-term mode’ that they don’t even
        mind that they’re the pursuers instead of him. <br /><br />
        It doesn’t matter if a guy like this wants a girlfriend or even a
        wife.
        <br /><br />
        He KNOWS that if he can get her to chase him, and get her into bed
        with him, she’s his.
        <br /><br />
        That’s not all though: ANY guy can do this… ANY guy can be
        <span class="color-orange"> “the short-term guy” </span>… and any guy
        can make girls chase. <br /><br />
        The way to do it is with three simple rules you’ll want to put into
        action with women today.

        </div>
        <div class="flex-grow-1 fs-20 ms-lg-28">
          Before we get into the rules, I should first introduce myself.
          <br /><br />
          Howdy there, my name’s Chase Amante.
          <br /><br />
          If this is the first time we’re meeting, well, you’re on the web’s
          most popular men’s dating advice site — one I founded in 2008, and
          which has since received over <strong>57 million visitors</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          At various points, we’ve ranked among the top 20,000 most visited
          websites in the world.
          <br /><br />
          My specialty is in not just picking up girls (and I am very good at
          that), but in getting girls to chase.<br /><br />
          This latter thing I’ve been doing since junior high, when I had an
          entire squad of cheerleaders pestering me for dates.<br />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-20 mb-0">
        Half the squad cornered me in the bleachers in gym class one day just
        to ask me out. The head cheerleader — the hottest, most popular girl
        in school — spent months chasing me down, and in high school I had
        more girls (from other cheerleaders to sexy punk and emo chicks)
        trying to get me onto dates.
        <br /><br />
        I studied pick up under several of the world’s leading pick up artists
        during and after my university years, and apprenticed under the
        founder of <span class="color-orange">“natural game.”</span> After
        watching him pick up BEAUTIFUL girls on the street and on park benches
        and sleep with them within hours, I began doing the same. <br /><br />
        I’ve lived on the East Coast of the US, the West Coast of the US, and
        outside the US too. I’ve picked up women in dozens of countries; the
        method I perfected to get girls chasing is one I’ve taught to men in
        96 different countries. I have ringing endorsements from Norway to
        Peru to Singapore to Saudi Arabia, the most restrictive country in the
        world for dating. This stuff works everywhere.
        <br /><br />
        In some ways, I guess, I’m a bit of an outlier. I certainly can’t say
        my life has been ORDINARY.
        <br /><br />
        Nevertheless, at Girls Chase I’ve created a website FILLED with
        resources aimed at “normal” men (but also, yeah, still serving outlier
        guys too, if they want it) that THEY can use to get girls.
        <br /><br />
        Our audience here is rabid… they love this stuff.
        <br /><br />
        <strong class="color-orange fst-italic">They love it because it WORKS!</strong>
        <br /><br />
        Right now, you are reading THE page for THE book that started it all —
        the “how to” guide that launched this website to the stratosphere;
        without which I wouldn’t have even bothered sticking around all these
        years helping millions of men.
        <br /><br />
        This manual, which I’m about to tell you about, has changed the lives
        of THOUSANDS of men, and served as priceless catalyst for them in
        understanding women, getting women to chase them, and sleeping with
        them (by the dozens or more. Sometimes much more!).
        <br /><br />
        So, read on — and let me tell you about the rules.

          Every guy knows this.
          <br /><br />
          It’s in every red pill manosphere video, article, or forum post ever
          created.
          <br /><br />
          Girls want the VALUABLE man.
          <br /><br />
          But what’s that MEAN?
          <br /><br />
          If you listen to the red pill manosphere guys, it means three
          things:
          <br /><br />
          <ol class="mb-0 ps-20 color-orange">
            <li>Money</li>
            <li>Muscles</li>

          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="fs-20">
        <p class="mb-0">
          The red pill manosphere brands itself as “contrary” to the
          mainstream. But what’s the MAINSTREAM say men need to excel with
          girls? Why it’s…
        </p>
        <br />
        <ol class="mb-0 ps-20 color-orange">
          <li>A good job (money)</li>
          <li>A healthy lifestyle (muscles)</li>
          <li>Respect in their community (status)</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p class="mb-0">
          They’re both telling men the same exact things! <br /><br />
          So I’ll tell you this, right now: you can be a jacked Adonis with
          $10 million in the bank, beloved by his community, and STILL have
          girls
          <span class="color-orange">“slow gaming”</span> you for that
          long-term boyfriend role… <br /><br />
          Meanwhile, these same girls will be sneaking out at night and having
          illicit liaisons with guys like me, my friends, and the students I
          teach!
          <br /><br />
          Clearly, girls still want value in their short-term flings…
          <br /><br />
          A guy must have SOME value for a girl to want him, chase him, and
          let him pick her up…
          <br /><br />
          But what KIND of value — well, that’s where both the mainstream and
          the red pill manosphere guys don’t have a clue!

          <br /><br />
          Sure, the actress might be HOTTER or SEXIER… but she’s also a lot

          Some men are MASTERS of compliance.
          <br /><br />
          They are really, really good at it.
          <br /><br />

          What’s that mean, a
          <span class="color-orange">“master of compliance”</span>?
          <br /><br />

          It means a guy who knows how to make a girl INVEST.
          <br /><br />

          He can make her invest over, and over, and more, and more, getting
          more and more roped into the pickup… More and more roped into him…
          <br /><br />

          … To the point she just DOESN’T want to leave the guy at all.
          <br /><br />

          Everyone from statesman-inventor Benjamin Franklin to lauded
          psychologist Robert Cialdini talks about how

      <div class="fs-20">
        <p class="mb-0">
          TRANSFORMATIVE the power of compliance is on other people.
          <br /><br />
          Once you get someone to comply, you can lead her almost anywhere.
          <br /><br />

          Yet what do most guys do?
          <br /><br />

          They do all the complying THEMSELVES!
          <br /><br />

          They pick up girls in their cars, drive them around, buy them food,
          buy them drinks, buy them tickets to shows, hold doors, offer their
          coats, and do all sorts of things girls ask them to.
          <br /><br />

          The more of this stuff the guy does for the girl, the more invested
          HE becomes, and the more committed to the courtship HE is… but it
          doesn’t have any effect upon HER!
          <br /><br />

          What gets girls hooked into a guy — so hooked they start to CHASE?
          <br /><br />

          When you get them to invest… and make them comply!

        When girls meet a high value man, whom they feel like they can get,
        who ALSO gets them to follow him around like the Pied Piper…
        <br /><br />
        Things get wild.
        <br /><br />
        Girls CHASE that guy.
        <br /><br />

        <br /><br />
        It’s not because of what he looks like. Girls chase short guys and
        ugly guys who do this too.
        <br /><br />
        It’s not because of how much money he has. Girls chase guys who are
        stone broke who do this.
        <br /><br />
        It’s not because of any social status he has. Girls chase guys who are
        nobodies who do this.
        <br /><br />

        It’s because that LETHAL combination — high value, balanced
        attainability, and high investment — makes girls chase.
        <br /><br />

        Just picture it: you approach a good-looking girl, exuding
        <span class="color-orange"> “high value” </span> from your pores…
        <br /><br />

        The instant you speak to her, you give her the sense that yes, she CAN
        get you… If just barely…
        <br /><br />

        Then, in seconds, you begin to ask her to do favors for you that make
        her invest more and more…
        <br /><br />

        This girl gets SO into you.
        <br /><br />

        She’s STARSTRUCK… even if you’re a
        <span class="color-orange">“nobody”</span>… <br /><br />

        She starts CHASING you…
        <br /><br />

        She starts doing more and more, completely on her own, to hook herself
        into you…
        <br /><br />

        Do you know how EASY it is to chat up girls, set up dates, pick them
        up, even have one-night stands and sparkling new relationships when
        those girls are chasing you?
        <br /><br />

        Well, I’ll tell you:
        <br /><br />

        <strong class="fst-italic">It’s EASY!</strong>
        <br /><br />

        WAY easier than when you do the chasing…
        <br /><br />

        So if you’ve been watching ‘man advice’ videos where the ‘guru’ is
        telling you it’s the man’s role to chase, that women always stay in
        that passive role, that the best thing you can do is go up and ‘shoot
        your shot’ and let HER decide if she’s going to accept or reject you…
        <br /><br />

        Well, ‘man role’ or not, just know that there is a much, MUCH better
        way.

              Chase, I followed your articles and book as best as I could....
              and things TOTALLY worked out! I got together with this girl on
              the FIRST NIGHT, and I had known her maybe a DAY. I had no idea
              things could move so fast if you just make every action one that
              moves things forward.

              Chase , I remember reading your book on an airplane. I had
              barely spoken to girls in my life, then I deep dived the girl

              I've been reading your website ever since I first stumbled upon
              <span class="color-orange">“How to Text a Girl”</span> using
              Google search engine. I have seen results and success starting
              the beginning of the year when I found it. After having great
              success with your website I figure I'd get the book to see how
              you put it all together. I just wanna say thanks a LOT man. My
              mannerism and approach to women changed after I finished reading
              the book. I've had a good deal of social experience but just
              needed something to tie it all together. The BEST part was that
              I could start out on intermediate level things with a decent
              amount of ease. I've already gained another lover in the past
              week since I bought your ebook. I don’t know how many guys would
              say thanks but for a guy that was shooting in the wind with hit
              or miss strategies and getting lucky...you really helped.
              <br /><br />
              Keep up the good work and I'll be looking forward to more of
              your reads.

              The book showed me a LOT of parallels that could be drawn...
              Your breakdown of the techniques was well done and enabled me to
              look at how I interact with women now and in the past. I can now
              see why I did so well... and sometimes not. While I'm very
              happily married, the techniques (and those of mine that I've
              realized and enhanced with your information), have accented my
              abilities in business and in everyday situations dealing with

              I had a serious inferiority complex and anxiety issues when it
              came to approaching/dating girls. I read “How to Make Girls
              Chase” and used a lot of things I learned from it. Now I am
              dating at least once a week and it is me who is rejecting the
              girls. My problem before was not recognizing that girls too have
              insecurities; now I can make them qualify themselves for me.
              Once I got that in, it has been amazing.

              Growing up, I was pretty clueless with women. I found Girls
              Chase in high school when I was trying to figure out how to get
              out of the friend zone. I was always seen as the nice guy. I had
              no experience and was not confident around girls at all. Chase's
              ebook, the articles on Girls Chase, and the forum all turned
              things around for me. Fast forward a few years and I'm a
              different man. I'm much more confident and comfortable around
              women, and I'm able to attract women like I never was able to
              before. Chase's work is incredible and I appreciate everything
              he's done.

              I am from Nairobi, Kenya. People from other parts of the world
              may think that Africa is a jungle but they are damn wrong. Chase
              Amante literally saved my life 6 years ago. People used to walk
              all over me, girls friend-zoned me brutality regardless of how I
              nicely I treated them. I got really bitter and resentful toward
              all women. No one around me seemed to provide any useful advice.
              I turned to google. The first article I came across was
              <span class="color-orange">
                12 Traits All Boring, Unsexy Nice Guys Have in Common </span>. I didn’t finish that article; it was
              talking about me. Over
              time though I became comfortable with reading cold truths. I
              began to understand that women were not the problem, I was the
              problem all along. I highly recommend Chase's book; How to Make

              From Chase's website, I learned a lot of tips that made common
              sense. It is very hard to find real and honest tips from the
              Internet that are not bullshit or only aim to rip you off. The
              appeal of dating women lies in charm and honesty. Chase
              demonstrates through his content that he has both. I have been
              on 10 new dates since reading Chase's book.

              How to Make Girls Chase changed my mindset into realising I
              needed to improve my fundamentals and change the dynamic to her
              chasing me. Since discovering Girls Chase I am having more fun
              out on dates, not overly sharing vulnerabilities, getting girls
              talking more, being playful, and spending more nights with
              women.

              I'm a guy in college. I was always researching how to improve my
              dating life, so I read so many other things that made me believe
              funny is the key to being attractive. When girls hooked, I tried
              hard to be funnier, only to end up to making myself a clown.
              Once I tired of being the clown I looked for more material and
              found Chase's book. When I read it changed my whole
              understanding about how attraction works. Now I actually get my
              date to turn into something more, and I’m getting lots of
              compliments from women too.

              I've always really wanted to have the skill of being good with
              women, and just being a more magnetic person. I was decent at
              best with girls and a few lays from time to time prior to
              finding Girls Chase. Maybe a couple girls I would see more than
              a few times. No serious girlfriends. I always used to blow it
              (self-sabotage) or things would fizzle, and I had no clue what
              to do. I stumbled on Girls Chase 2ish years ago and the material
              I discovered here changed my entire game and perspective. Not
              only did my dating fundamentals improve right away, I also got A
              LOT more attention from girls than I ever did before completely
              naturally. I got the How to Make Girls Chase ebook. I realized
              pretty quick what I'd been doing wrong (no backbone, big inner
              game issues, no edge or excitement). My results exploded once I
              implemented GC. I started easily attracted girls that before I
              would have just drooled over from afar, just by being the
              improved, polished version of who I already was! This stuff is
              so amazing, you'd be a fool to not help yourself to this
              transformative process.

              I'm 50 years old, and I felt like I lost the window for the
              current generation of women who feel sexual freedom. I mean, who
              really wants a 50-year-old woman, unless he's in his seventies?
              This really changed when I learned how to talk to younger women.
              One day, I had to borrow a friend's notebook computer, and he
              still had your site open to girlschase.com. I couldn't stop
              reading! He also had several Girls Chase books in his documents

              <span class="color-orange">‘What Women Want’</span> back in
              2013. I was good with women, but I wanted to understand women
              more psychologically. I had been with about 10 women before
              Girls Chase, but I had weight issues that hindered me from
              getting into commitments with women. I improved my fundamentals
              and suddenly girls were checking me out left and right. I got
              How to Make Girls Chase, then How to Text Girls, then One Date,
              and they've all helped tremendously, from understanding women's
              minds, my style, relationships, and concrete mindsets that will
              last with me for a lifetime.

              Hi Chase,
              <br /><br />
              I just had to take a minute and thank you for this website. I
              think it is absolutely AMAZING, and it has changed my life in so
              many ways. I used to be very insecure about myself, and well,
              women in general.
              <br /><br />
              Reading your book, following your blog and putting all these
              things into practise, I found out girls are MUCH more receptive
              of me than I ever thought possible.
              <br /><br />
              After just a couple of months I am able to get a fair amount,
              and STEADY success with women. For example, yesterday I managed
              to do my first 5 minute bar pull. All I had to do was pull the
              girl in, she tried to kiss me, and I used the “Not here” example
              from your book. Her response was telling me to get her out of
              there... and I did.
              <br /><br />
              A big thank you from a VERY happy reader.

          There’s no other men’s guide to picking up and seducing women that
          comes close to the completeness of “HTMGC.”
          <br /><br />
          Despite how entire this book is, the method contained within it is
          simple and to-the-point.
          <br /><br />
          ANY man can learn to use it with women… EVEN IF:

          <ul class="mb-0 ps-20 orange-dics">
            <li class="mb-10">

            </li>
            <li class="mb-10">
              He feels like he doesn’t lead a very interesting life.
            </li>
            <li>
              He’s gone a long time without lovers, dates, or even talking to
              women.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          The method you will find inside How to Make Girls Chase works SO
          well because it relies on those three rules of what makes women
          chase:
          <br /><br />
          <ol class="mb-0 ps-20 orange-dics">
            <li class="mb-10">VALUE that women simply have to have</li>
            <li class="mb-10">
              ATTAINABILITY that lets them feel they can have it
            </li>
            <li>
              COMPLIANCE that gets them acting & following as they pursue it
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          Taken together, we call this ‘VAC’ — value, attainability, and
          compliance.
          <br /><br />
          With HTMGC & VAC in your corner, making girls chase you gets EASY.

          <strong>Guys who want to use it for “nefarious purposes.”</strong>
          Look, I’m not going to tell you you have to marry every girl who
          blows a kiss at you. I’m totally fine with men hooking up. What I
          DON’T want is guys using this to get girls chasing them they are
          just “toying around” with… or to get girls totally obsessed with
          them who they aren’t actually serious about. If you just want a
          quick fling with her, it’s okay to make her chase a bit for it; but
          if you’re hooking girls wildly, desperately in only to “inflate your
          ego”, this book is not for you.

          <strong>Guys who are totally committed “nice guys.”</strong> I don’t

          nay, TELL you — to get girls doing stuff for you. A LOT of stuff for
          you! So if your approach to life is “I have to serve women; I really
          have to do everything I can for women. Women should never lift a
          finger for me”, and you’re unwilling to change that to get girls
          chasing, then I’m sorry to say but this is not the right book for
          you.

          Maybe it’s all about looks! Maybe it’s all about money! Whatever!
          I’ll be honest: I don’t care too much about any of those. This book
          tells you how to improve your appearance to be sufficiently
          attractive to get whatever girl you want. And with VAC you’re
          basically reverse engineering status, even if you don’t really have
          status in a particular group or venue (yet). But really, I mean…
          it’s hard to care about how chiseled your jaw is or how many zeroes
          are in your bank account when your phone is blowing up with really
          hot girls desperate to get you onto dates or come over to your
          place. So if you’re really focused on how other dudes are doing
          (like how rich guy ABC is, or how good-looking dude DEF is, or
          whatever), this book is just going to be the wrong wavelength for
          you… because the ONLY thing we care about here is putting more girls
          in your phone, onto dates with you, and on your d!ck.

        Now, if you are NOT one of those guys, and you would like to get the
        choicest girls in your city or town chasing after you, wrapped around
        your little finger (because they’re just so compliant to you now),
        then read on…

        Let’s take a look at what you will learn inside HTMGC…
      </p>
      <ul class="orange-dics fs-20">
        <li class="mb-20">
          A dead-simple way to get past “approach anxiety.” Start doing this
          and it gets easy to summon new women into your life. — pg. 3
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          Why you’re PROBABLY talking too much to women… and how to get women
          chasing you by saying less (plus: how talking about yourself too
          much and “being too funny” in fact sabotages men’s seductions — so
          quit doing it!). — pg. 86
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          What the three (3) kinds of compliance are… and which to use to make
          women committed to pursuing you (this lets you RAMP UP their
          attraction sky-high!). — pg. 146
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          A straightforward process to move quickly from repartee (an early
          part of the seduction) to rapport (a later part). This is crucial to
          know, because men who spend too long in the “teasing phase” or
          bantering around usually end up going home ALONE. — pg. 63
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          How to cut your dates short (or even skip them entirely) and get
          girls running to your bed FAST… so you can avoid having to spend
          lots of time or money on dating. — pg. 280
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          The two (2) kinds of value — and why the kind most men try to show
          puts women OFF (with How to Make Girls Chase, you’ll start using the
          type of value women THIRST for!). — pg. 114
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          What the “tension gap” is, and how failing to overcome it makes
          interactions with women really awkward (causing men who are
          beginners to LOSE so many girls they should have got!). — pg. 251
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          How to leverage the “awesome power” of Social Momentum to meet new
          girls in a hurry. Social Momentum doesn’t only get you lots of
          numbers, dates, and lays, either; it makes you so compelling that
          women start to chase. — pg. 34
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          The art of “pre-opening”: a rejection-proofing strategy that warms
          girls up to talking with you before you ever say a word to them. You
          MUST know this if you EVER talk to girls in-person at all! — pg. 50
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          The “Boyfriend Dead Zone”: why girls who think you want to be their
          boyfriends will NOT chase you… and what to do to avoid the
          “Boyfriend Dead Zone” and get the girl (yes, you can even use this
          to make her your girlfriend, IF you want!). — pg. 332
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          My secret to get women investing in and chasing you the MOMENT you
          meet them (this makes them stick around and get to know you you more
          from the outset, rather than “go back to their friends” or say
          goodbye). — pg. 143
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          The Law of Least Effort, a universal “human interaction law” that
          underlies ALL of interpersonal social power… with the Law of Least
          Effort in your corner, you WILL be cool, and girls can’t help but
          chase… yet you must get the Law right (so many casual students
          misunderstand how to use it — it’s all laid out inside HTMGC). — pg.
          25
        </li>

        <li class="mb-20">
          How to make moves in the bedroom that draw girls to your bed or even
          get them stripping off their clothes and tackling you themselves…
          with this escalation method you can kiss “goodbye” to disappointing
          pulls that don’t end in sex. Once you start doing this, girls won’t
          even agree to LEAVE your place until you’ve satisfied them! — pg.
          361
        </li>

        <li>
          Two “right there with me”, incredibly detailed Lay Reports where I
          walk you through a couple of my own pick ups… from the first
          approach to getting the girls to chase me to taking them home to
          “seal the deal.” See exactly how it all works, laid out end-to-end,
          open to close, so you can easily put all the pieces together. — pg.
          382
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-20">
        … and more.
        <br /><br />
        With THIS tome in hand, not only will girls chase you… you’ll have
        trouble getting a moment alone!

        If THAT doesn’t get you excited for what’s to come, you don’t have a
        pulse!
        <br /><br />
        And it all costs…
        <br /><br />
        (Drum roll please)

        No, not $500 (though it really should… I’m serious).

          Want an under-the-radar way to open her (and NEVER worry about
          someone yelling “harassment!”)? Slow opening’s the way. I’ve used it
          to chat up girls for one-night stands — and even a future

        “What if I start reading and it’s just not for me?” — Some Guy
        <br /><br />
        Well, let me tell you what — if that happens, you’re completely
        covered.
        <br /><br />
        Starting from the instant you buy, you’ve got ninety (90) full days to
        test drive the material from the book. You can start doing Homework #1
        the FIRST day.
        <br /><br />
        I suggest you take at least two weeks to try the material out and go
        through the homework assignments. There’s a LOT to do that will get
        you into gear and get girls chasing YOU!
        <br /><br />
        But take as long as you need… 21 days… 30 days… 60 days… heck, 75 days
        even…
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Try out the material for up to 90 full days.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        IF by the end of that period you do NOT have at least 3 or 4 new
        dates…
        <br /><br />
        If you don’t have at least ONE good-looking girl messaging you trying
        to meet up…
        <br /><br />
        If you haven’t started seeing more pretty heads turning, and seen more
        girls sending signals your way…
        <br /><br />
        Just send me an email or give me a call and I’ll give you a FULL
        REFUND.
        <br /><br />
        Your refund is <strong>GUARANTEED…</strong> for ANY reason.
        <br /><br />
        I have even had <span class="color-orange">“unscrupulous”</span> guys
        contact me and tell me they loved the book, it’s helped them so much,
        girls are going CRAZY for them thanks to it… but they need the money
        now for all the dating they’re doing so they’re asking for a refund.
        And I HAVE to GIVE it to them because it’s within 90 days! (That’s how
        unconditional guarantees work, after all) <br /><br />
        So yeah — when I say
        <span class="color-orange">“unconditional”</span>, I mean
        unconditional. <br /><br />
        You’re covered.
        <br /><br />
        Don’t even worry about it.
        <br /><br />
        <strong>Go test the book out and if you’re not happy within 90 days, just
          tell me for a full refund.</strong>

        Have you ever heard of The Attraction Handbook?
        <br /><br />
        It’s a REALLY good book on picking up girls. Kind of a manual for me.
        It’s not available online anymore and you cannot buy it ANYWHERE. The
        company that was selling it closed down.
        <br /><br />
        Ever hear of Stripper Secrets?
        <br /><br />
        It’s the best book ever written on picking up strippers. Know where
        you can find it? NOWHERE — it vanished from the Internet over a decade
        ago.

          How about the famed interview series with Rick H., one of the
          earliest inspirations for the seduction community, and still
          arguably the best interviews with a seducer EVER recorded?
          <br /><br />
          They’re completely gone. You can’t buy them anywhere. Faded away
          into smoke.
          <br /><br />
          I’m going to be totally honest with you: as a business, teaching
          guys to pick up girls kind of sucks. There aren’t many guys who want
          to learn this stuff… most are content to stay sitting in front of
          their phone screens staring at women’s social media wondering why
          girls aren’t liking their photos or responding to their clever
          comments.
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-20">
        So what happens over time is the guys who are teaching this stuff
        sooner or later close up shop and go do something else with their
        time… something more lucrative.
        <br /><br />
        And alllllll the knowledge they had on picking up girls, and getting
        girls to chase you, and landing EXACTLY the girl or girls you really,
        really wanted goes away.
        <br /><br />

        So if you ARE a guy who wants to learn this stuff, you’d better get
        this today.
        <br /><br />

        When I got into this stuff, there were hundreds of seduction
        companies, and many of the BEST guides and programs ever created were
        on the market.
        <br /><br />

        Today there’s a tiny fraction of as many companies, and most of the
        best products are LONG GONE.
        <br /><br />

        I’m going to keep Girls Chase online as long as I can… I feel like I’m
        doing a service for men.
        <br /><br />

        But sooner or later this site, like every other site like it before,
        and the guides and courses on this site, are going to disappear.
        <br /><br />

        When that happens, you won’t be able to buy How to Make Girls Chase
        anymore.
        <br /><br />

        Remember, it’s not on Amazon.
        <br /><br />

        It’s not at Barnes & Noble.
        <br /><br />

        There’s only ONE place you can buy it:
        <br /><br />

        Right here, on
        <a class="text-decoration-underline fw-bold color-orange hover-color-gray-700"
          href="https://girlschase.com">GirlsChase.com</a>. <br /><br />

        And when this site’s gone, this unequaled method to get girls chasing
        you goes with it.
        <br /><br />

        So get in now, or regret it when it’s gone.

        Mopey dopes DON’T buy How to Make Girls Chase.
        <br /><br />
        They DON’T use the material from it to get girls chasing them.
        <br /><br />
        They DON’T put the homework from the book into action to learn this
        stuff cold.
        <br /><br />
        They just mope about, complaining like a dope, as eligible women in
        their towns become available, hit the dating scene, flirt, go on
        dates, then settle into new relationships, only for the cycle to
        repeat with more single women… then more… then MORE… with these guys
        ALWAYS seated on the sidelines.
        <br /><br />
        They miss <span class="color-orange"> ‘cycle after cycle’ </span> of
        single, available, eligible women, all because they’re just too busy
        being mopey dopes. <br /><br />
        And all the while, TIME keeps ticking by.
        <br /><br />
        Time’s the one thing no man can ever get back.
        <br /><br />
        You can make more money. You can get another girl!
        <br /><br />
        But TIME is irreplaceable.
        <br /><br />
        Life is short, and it goes by faster than we think.
        <br /><br />
        Riddle me this — what sounds better: a melancholy life spent being a
        lonely <span class="color-orange">‘mopey dope’</span>… <br /><br />
        OR a life filled to bursting with exactly the kind of girls you MOST
        desire, chasing after YOU?
        <br /><br />
        I know which one I decided *I* wanted, all those years ago.
        <br /><br />
        It’s why I learned the stuff that’s in this book — and why I wrote it
        all down so it couldn’t be forgotten.
        <br /><br />
        So say <span class="color-orange">“yes”</span> to being the guy women
        chase (instead of just a mopey dope):

          I’ll tell you a secret…
          <br /><br />
          This has surprised me over the years.
          <br /><br />
          You see, when I wrote How to Make Girls Chase in 2010, I actually
          thought it was going to be something I threw on a website, sold a
          few copies of, and then it’d never be heard of again.
          <br /><br />
          This was a book (it might be hard to believe now) I wrote for ME…
          written to be complete and timeless… because I didn’t intend to
          still be running this site years from now, and I wanted a compendium
          of everything I’d learned to do with girls.
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p class="fs-20">
        I wanted it alllll written down, as timeless and elemental as
        possible, so that if I ever needed to come back to it years later, or
        hand to my sons, it’d be there, written in full, as applicable as
        ever, recorded while I was at the prime of my game.
        <br /><br />
        Well, it’s been over a decade since I published the book… it’s sold
        4,000 copies despite never being sold ANYWHERE other than on Girls
        Chase websites (no Amazon, no Barnes & Noble, no nuthin’!).
        <br /><br />
        Yet, even today, guys still message me to tell me this book is
        mind-bogglingly good and has changed their games forever.
        <br /><br />
        I’ve released many different programs over the years; some better than
        others…
        <br /><br />

        Yet How to Make Girls Chase, that book I wrote way back when I didn’t
        even think I’d be sticking around in this space, continues to be the
        most beloved thing I’ve ever put out.
        <br /><br />

        I’m pretty certain you’re going to LOVE this book.
        <br /><br />

        The methods inside it transformed my life forever.
        <br /><br />

        They’ve transformed the lives of thousands of men.
        <br /><br />

        I’m confident they’ll transform yours, too.
        <br /><br />

        Take the plunge, and let’s meet in the pages of HTMGC.

      <p class="fs-20">
        P.S. Be prepared to feel like a little bit of a dick. That’s because
        once you ‘flip the game’ such that girls start chasing you, the ENTIRE
        dating dynamic flips with it. You know how girls ghost on you, flake
        on you, and are just generally unreliable? That’s because they’ve got
        lots of male options and it’s honestly hard juggling all that. Once
        YOU’RE the one they’re chasing, YOU become the ‘hot girl.’ You’re now
        the ghosty/flakey one. Girls start pestering you for dates, wondering
        why you cancelled and didn’t reschedule, pushing to meet sooner or
        offering better terms. You start being able to tell girls to come
        straight over to your place and they just DO — because it’s the only
        way they can see you! Girls will MOAN about this but still do it
        anyway. You might start to feel like a tad of an asshole… but it’s
        just how it goes when the dynamic flips to girls in pursuit. You don’t
        just flip one part of dating… you flip it all. So buckle up.
        <br /><br />
        P.P.S. Here’s just a suggestion: once you’re following the method in
        How to Make Girls Chase, you’re going to start getting a lot more
        success with girls. In fact, you will probably end up sleeping with
        the HOTTEST girl you’ve ever been with. What a lot of guys do when
        this happens is to INSTANTLY make that new ‘hottest girl ever’ their
        committed girlfriend. “Gotta lock this rare bird down!” their brains
        say. Well, I want you to try your best to not do that. Sleep with that
        really hot girl, but DON’T commit. Not yet. Why? Because what “finally
        doing things right with girls” does for you is to unlock a wholly new
        dating paradigm. So yes, you will suddenly get a much hotter girl or
        two… but if you stay at it you will quickly find you get a lot of much
        hotter girls! Then you can choose a girlfriend from a pool of really
        desirable girls, which is just way better. It’s a lot better than
        going with the first super hottie who falls into your lap once you
        start using the system — because what we’re really talking about here
        is choice, and choice changes everything.

                Believe it or not, there are a lot of super good-looking,
                famous, and well-known guys who girls don’t chase either. I
                should know; I’m the one coaching them! What makes a woman
                chase a man — or not — has much less to do with what he HAS
                than what he DOES: those specific behaviors we talk about in
                HTMGC that cause girls to feel ‘starstruck’ by a man who
                conveys himself in a high value way, while seeming just
                attainable enough, and getting that girl to comply, comply,
                COMPLY!
